Clustering Project Read Me

## Purpose
 The Purpose of this project was to find what the biggest driver of log error was, and 
 how to predict it

 ## Hypothesis
 - The tax value and location would be signifigant factors in log error
 - The amount of people per county would determine how accurate the zestimate was, thus predicting 
 log error

## Pipeline
 ### Aquire
 Using a SQL query/ csv file to gather the data
 ### Preparing
 Cleaning and filtering the data
 ### Exploring
 Finding features and graphs that find corrolation
 ### Model
 Creating a model that would accuratly predict log error
