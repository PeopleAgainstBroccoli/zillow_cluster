    "- Location: certain geographic areas may be harder to accurately predict than others. Log error may differ by County. \n",
    "- Price: higher prices may have more variance which makes them harder to predict\n",
    "- Age of Property: newer homes may be similarily built, thus easier to predict price. Older property values may have more variance, thus making them harder to predict\n",
    "- Amenities: fireplace, pool, hot tub, and garage are nice amenities that not all properties include. These amenities may be driving log error by making property values harder to predict.\n",
    "- Data density: geographic areas with more data points (higher data density) will have lower log errors. Geogrphaic areas with less data points (lower data density) will have higher log errors. The more data we have in a given geographic area, the lower we would expect those log errors to be."
